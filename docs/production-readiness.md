# Production Readiness & Feature Implementation Guide

This document outlines the concrete engineering work required to take the AutoHire scaffold to a functionally production-ready platform while addressing the user's additional requirements for job aggregation from Google search results and CV tailoring workflows that integrate with desktop word processors and ChatGPT-driven Playwright automations.

## 1. Core Production Hardening

### 1.1 Application Stability & Quality
- **End-to-end feature delivery**: Flesh out the placeholder FastAPI routes and Next.js pages into real CRUD flows covering candidate onboarding, job management, applications, microtasks, and admin tooling.
- **Testing strategy**: Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end (Playwright) tests. Gate merges through CI (GitHub Actions) that run `pytest`, `ruff`/`mypy`, `jest`, and `eslint`. Add smoke tests for Celery tasks and job ingestion pipelines.
- **Observability maturity**: Wire metrics, traces, and logs into Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki. Provide dashboards for API latency, worker throughput, search performance, Google ingestion success rates, and CV automation outcomes.
- **Security review**: Harden authentication (Keycloak integration, secure cookies, CSRF protection) and authorization (role-based access, data partitioning). Ensure secrets management across environments (Vault or cloud secrets manager). Add SAST/Dependency scanning.

### 1.2 Deployment & Operations
- **Database migrations**: Adopt Alembic for FastAPI to evolve Postgres schema. Provide migration automation in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Container hardening**: Produce production-grade Dockerfiles (multi-stage, pinned versions, non-root users). Use Docker Compose for dev and Helm/Kubernetes manifests or Nomad for production deployment. Enable health checks and readiness probes.
- **Resilience**: Configure backups (Postgres WAL archiving, MinIO object versioning), implement caching (Redis), rate limiting, and circuit breakers. Document recovery runbooks.
- **Compliance**: Address GDPR-style deletion/export, audit logging, and privacy policies. Ensure Google scraping and ChatGPT automation comply with respective terms of service.

## 2. Google Job Search Aggregation

### 2.1 Discoverability Strategy
- **Official APIs first**: Prefer the [Google Custom Search JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction) or the Jobs Search API where available to avoid ToS violations. Configure programmable search engines scoped to job sites and parameterize queries via Celery tasks.
- **Fallback scraping**: If API coverage is insufficient, implement Playwright-based scraping that respects robots.txt, rate limits, and geographic restrictions. Maintain per-site adapters to extract job metadata (title, company, location, compensation, posting URL).

### 2.2 Pipeline Architecture
- **Task scheduling**: Extend the `apps/worker` service with Celery beat schedules that enqueue Google job search ingestion tasks per keyword/location combination. Parameterize search criteria stored in Postgres.
- **HTML parsing**: Use Playwright to render search result pages, capture structured data with CSS selectors/XPath, and normalize into the internal job schema. Deduplicate via canonical URLs and hashes.
- **Enrichment**: Augment scraped jobs with geocoding (Nominatim), skill extraction (spaCy or keyword heuristics), and embeddings (MiniLM) before persisting.
- **Indexing**: Push normalized jobs into Postgres, Meilisearch, and Qdrant for hybrid search. Tag jobs with source metadata for transparency.
- **Monitoring**: Record ingestion metrics (success/failure counts, latency) and alerts for captcha/blocked requests. Provide manual override tools in the Admin console.

### 2.3 UI & API Integrations
- **API exposure**: Add FastAPI endpoints (e.g., `GET /jobs/aggregated`) that unify native employer jobs and Google-ingested jobs. Include filtering by source, freshness, and relevance.
- **Front-end updates**: Enhance the candidate portal job search to surface aggregated listings, including map pins and distinct labeling for external sources. Offer direct-apply or outbound links based on site capabilities.

## 3. CV Tailoring & Desktop Word Integration

### 3.1 Document Generation Pipeline
- **Structured templates**: Store resume templates in Postgres/MinIO (JSON or DOCX). Use python-docx or templating (Jinja2) to assemble tailored resumes, then export to DOCX and PDF for download.
- **Candidate inputs**: Provide UI for candidates to define target job parameters and highlight skills to emphasize. Persist tailoring history for auditability.
- **Local export**: Extend the front-end to offer secure download endpoints that serve generated DOCX/PDF files for local editing.

### 3.2 ChatGPT-Assisted Tailoring via Playwright
- **Automation agent**: Implement a Celery task that launches Playwright (headless Chromium) authenticated into the candidate's ChatGPT session using stored session tokens (with explicit consent and secure storage). The task submits prompts containing anonymized candidate data and target job descriptions to ChatGPT, retrieves improved bullet points, and logs the interaction.
- **Compliance safeguards**: Provide clear disclaimers about storing OpenAI session tokens, respect rate limits, and allow candidates to revoke access. Offer an alternative path using the OpenAI API (with user-provided API key) to avoid browser automation if preferred.
- **Post-processing**: Parse ChatGPT responses, apply grammar/consistency checks, and merge results into template sections (experience summaries, cover letters). Allow manual review before finalizing.

### 3.3 Microsoft Word Integration
- **Word Add-in**: Develop an Office.js add-in that connects to the AutoHire API, pulling tailored CV drafts and allowing one-click insertion into the open Word document. Provide login via OAuth (Keycloak) and secure data transit.
- **Manual workflow**: Document fallback instructions for users to copy generated content from the AutoHire web app into Word, edit locally, and re-upload via the resume management interface.
- **Version sync**: Implement file diffing and change tracking when re-importing edited DOCX files to keep profile data and resume text synchronized.

## 4. Playwright-Based CV Automation Desktop Flow

- **Local agent**: Provide an optional desktop automation script (Python + Playwright) that users can run on their own machines. The script would:
  1. Read candidate profile/resume JSON exported from the AutoHire API.
  2. Launch a local browser session logged into ChatGPT.
  3. Execute scripted prompts to generate improved CV content.
  4. Copy the output into the clipboard or directly into an open Word document via the Word JavaScript API or simulated key presses.
  5. Save the updated document locally and upload back to AutoHire through authenticated API calls.
- **User control**: Ensure the script pauses for user approval before submitting prompts or overwriting documents. Provide configuration for prompt templates and output formatting.
- **Security**: Emphasize that storing ChatGPT credentials or tokens locally carries risk; recommend using environment variables or secure credential stores.

## 5. Roadmap & Milestones

1. **M1 – Robust Foundation**: Complete CRUD implementations, authentication/authorization, and CI pipelines. Deliver baseline dashboards and alerting.
2. **M2 – Google Aggregation Alpha**: Deploy Google API integration or Playwright scraping with limited criteria. Surface aggregated jobs in the candidate portal and track ingestion metrics.
3. **M3 – CV Tailoring Beta**: Deliver template-driven resume generation, downloadable DOCX/PDF, and manual tailoring UI.
4. **M4 – ChatGPT Automation & Word Add-in**: Release Playwright automation tasks, session management, and Office.js integration with documented consent flows.
5. **M5 – Production Hardening**: Conduct load testing, security assessments, failover drills, and finalize documentation/runbooks prior to launch.

## 6. Legal & Ethical Considerations

- **Terms of Service**: Review Google's, OpenAI's, and any targeted job site's terms to ensure scraping and automation are permitted. Consider partnerships or API agreements for high-volume usage.
- **User privacy**: Handle candidate documents and AI prompts with strict confidentiality. Provide data processing agreements and opt-out mechanisms.
- **Transparency**: Clearly label AI-assisted content and external job sources to maintain user trust.

By following this guide, the team can evolve the AutoHire scaffold into a production-ready platform that meets the requested Google job aggregation and CV tailoring automation capabilities while maintaining compliance, security, and user trust.
