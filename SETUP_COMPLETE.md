4. Verify AI is reading the file (check settings)

### Generated Code Doesn't Match Rules
1. Review rules for clarity and specificity
2. Test with simple requests first
3. Provide more context in prompts
4. Add specific examples to rules

### Performance Issues
1. Keep rules concise and focused
2. Avoid overly complex or contradictory rules
3. Test rules with actual code generation
4. Remove unused or outdated rules
