# 🧠 Conscious Operator System - Complete Guide

## What This Achieves

Transforms the automation from **scripted** → **conscious**:

### Before (Scripted):
```python
# Fixed script - breaks if page changes
click("#apply-button")
fill("#name", "John")
click("#submit")
# ❌ Fails if selectors change, can't adapt
```

### After (Conscious):
```python
# Vision-based decision making
vision = operator.see()  # Takes screenshot, analyzes page
action = operator.think(vision, goal)  # Decides what to do
operator.act(action)  # Executes
operator.verify(action, vision)  # Checks it worked
# ✅ Adapts to changes, recovers from failures
```

---

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

### 1. **Vision-Based Operation**
- Takes screenshots
- Analyzes DOM structure
- Reads visible text, buttons, inputs
- Makes decisions based on what it sees NOW

### 2. **Adaptive Decision Making**
Can use:
- **AI Models** (Claude/GPT-4V) - Analyzes screenshots to decide actions
- **Rule-based** - Fast, cheap for simple cases
- **Hybrid** - Combines both for efficiency

### 3. **Self-Healing**
- Detects failures (captcha, timeouts, errors)
- Attempts recovery automatically
- Learns what works
- Can work for hours without intervention

### 4. **Continuous Learning**
- Remembers successful strategies
- Avoids failed approaches
- Builds knowledge base over time
- Gets smarter with use

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage (No AI)

```python
from app.services.conscious_operator import ConsciousOperator, Goal

# Create operator
operator = ConsciousOperator(headless=False)
operator.start_session(user_data_dir=".browser_profile")

# Navigate to starting point
operator.page.goto("https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=python+developer")

# Define goal
goal = Goal(
    objective="Apply to first Python Developer job",
    success_criteria=["application submitted", "thank you"],
    failure_indicators=["session expired"],
    max_attempts=10,
    max_duration_minutes=15
)

# Work towards goal (adapts automatically)
success = operator.work_towards_goal(goal)

operator.close_session()
```

### With AI Decision Making

```python
from app.services.ai_decision_engine import create_conscious_operator_with_ai
from app.services.conscious_operator import Goal

# Create operator with Claude vision
operator = create_conscious_operator_with_ai(
    api_key="sk-ant-...",  # Your Anthropic API key
    provider="claude"
)

operator.start_session()
operator.page.goto("https://www.linkedin.com/jobs")

goal = Goal(
    objective="Apply to Senior Python Engineer positions",
    success_criteria=["application sent", "thank you for applying"],
    max_attempts=5,
    max_duration_minutes=20
)

# Operator uses AI to analyze screenshots and decide actions
success = operator.work_towards_goal(goal)

operator.close_session()
```

### Continuous Operation (Hours)

```python
from app.services.operator_resilience import ContinuousWorker, KnowledgeBase
from app.services.conscious_operator import ConsciousOperator, Goal

# Create operator
operator = ConsciousOperator(headless=False)
operator.start_session(user_data_dir=".browser_profile")

# Create knowledge base (persists learning)
knowledge_base = KnowledgeBase("autohire_knowledge.pkl")

# Create continuous worker
worker = ContinuousWorker(operator, knowledge_base)

# Job queue
job_urls = [
    "https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=abc123",
    "https://www.seek.com.au/job/xyz789",
    # ... 100 more jobs
]

def next_job():
    """Generate next goal"""
    if not job_urls:
        return None

    url = job_urls.pop(0)
    operator.page.goto(url)

    return Goal(
        objective="Apply to this job",
        success_criteria=["application submitted"],
        max_attempts=5,
        max_duration_minutes=10
    )

# Work for 8 hours or until all jobs done
worker.work_continuously(
    goal_generator=next_job,
    max_duration_hours=8
)

# Report
print(f"Completed: {worker.total_goals_completed}")
print(f"Failed: {worker.total_goals_failed}")
print(f"Learned strategies: {len(knowledge_base.strategies)}")
```

---

## 🧠 Decision Making Modes

### Mode 1: Rule-Based (Fast, Free)
```python
operator = ConsciousOperator()
# Uses built-in rules:
# - If see "Apply" button → click it
# - If see empty form field → fill it with appropriate value
# - If see success message → mark complete
```

### Mode 2: AI-Powered (Smart, Costs API calls)
```python
from app.services.ai_decision_engine import AIDecisionEngine

ai = AIDecisionEngine(provider="claude", api_key="sk-...")
operator.decision_engine = ai.decide_action

# Now operator uses Claude vision to:
# - Analyze screenshots
# - Understand page context
# - Make intelligent decisions
```

### Mode 3: Hybrid (Best of both)
```python
from app.services.ai_decision_engine import HybridDecisionEngine, AIDecisionEngine

ai = AIDecisionEngine(provider="claude", api_key="sk-...")
hybrid = HybridDecisionEngine(ai)
operator.decision_engine = hybrid.decide

# Uses rules for simple cases (95% of actions)
# Uses AI for complex decisions (5% of actions)
# Optimal cost/performance balance
```

---

## 🔄 How It Works Internally

```python
# THE CONSCIOUS LOOP

while not goal_achieved:
    # 1. SEE - Capture current state
    vision = operator.see()
    # → Screenshot, DOM, visible elements, page text

    # 2. THINK - Decide what to do
    action = operator.think(vision, goal)
    # → Analyzes: "I see an Apply button, clicking it will progress toward goal"

    # 3. ACT - Execute decision
    success = operator.act(action)
    # → Clicks, types, scrolls, navigates

    # 4. VERIFY - Check it worked
    if success:
        verified = operator.verify(action, vision)
        if verified:
            # Continue to next action
        else:
            # Action didn't work, try different approach

    # 5. ADAPT - Learn from result
    # If successful → remember strategy
    # If failed → avoid this approach
```

---

## 🛡️ Resilience Features

### Automatic Recovery

```python
# Operator detects and recovers from:

✅ Captchas → Waits for manual solving or uses service
✅ Session timeouts → Refreshes and re-authenticates
✅ Rate limiting → Waits appropriate time
✅ Network errors → Retries with exponential backoff
✅ UI changes → Adapts to new layout
✅ Unexpected popups → Handles or dismisses
```

### Failure Handling

```python
# Built-in strategies:

if consecutive_failures >= 3:
    # Cooldown period
    sleep(60)

if error == "captcha":
    # Wait for manual intervention
    sleep(30)

if error == "rate_limit":
    # Back off
    sleep(120)

# All automatically logged and learned from
```

## 📚 Learning System

### What Gets Learned

1. **Successful Strategies**
   ```python
   # "On LinkedIn, clicking the blue button labeled 'Easy Apply' works 90% of the time"
   strategy = {
       'goal': 'apply_to_job',
       'site': 'linkedin',
       'actions': [click_blue_easy_apply_button],
       'success_rate': 0.90
   }
   ```

2. **Field Mappings**
   ```python
   # "Field with placeholder 'Full Name' should get 'John Galgano'"
   field_mappings = {
       'input[placeholder*="Full Name"]': 'John Galgano',
       'input[type="email"]': 'john@example.com'
   }
   ```

3. **Recovery Strategies**
   ```python
   # "When see 'Session Expired', refresh page and re-login works 80% of time"
   recovery = {
       'error': 'session_expired',
       'actions': [refresh, fill_login, click_submit],
       'success_rate': 0.80
   }
   ```

### Knowledge Persistence

```python
# Automatically saved to disk
knowledge_base = KnowledgeBase("autohire_knowledge.pkl")

# Grows over time:
# Day 1: 0 strategies
# Week 1: 20 strategies
# Month 1: 100+ strategies
# → Gets smarter with use
```

    goal_generator=next_job,
    max_duration_hours=8
)

# Results:
# ✅ Applied to 47 jobs
# ❌ Failed on 3 jobs (already applied)
# 📚 Learned 12 new strategies
# ⏱️ Ran for 8 hours 2 minutes
```
