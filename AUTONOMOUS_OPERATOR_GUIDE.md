## 🎯 What You Have Now

I've created **3 levels** of autonomous job application operators, each with increasing sophistication:

### Level 1: Simple Job Browser ✅
**File:** `simple_job_operator.py`
- Searches Seek.com.au
- Extracts 5 jobs
- Opens tabs for review
- **No applications** - manual review only

### Level 2: Advanced Vision Operator ✅
**File:** `advanced_application_operator.py`
- **Computer vision** (OCR with pytesseract)
- **Desktop control** (pyautogui)
- **Form auto-fill** with CV data
- **CV file upload**
- **Real-time visual feedback**
- **Screenshot capture**

### Level 3: Targeted Application Bot ✅
**File:** `apply_to_open_jobs.py`
- Works with specific job URLs
- Full vision analysis
- Intelligent form detection
- Auto-fills: email, name, phone, CV
- Keeps pages open for final review
- Generates application log

## 🎓 How to Use with Your Job Search

### Step 1: Update Your CV
Replace `sample_cv.txt` with your actual CV, or create a new one:
```
YOUR NAME
Your Job Title

EMAIL: your.email@example.com
PHONE: (555) 123-4567
LOCATION: Melbourne, Australia

... rest of CV ...
```

### Step 2: Run Simple Search First
```bash
python simple_job_operator.py
```
This opens 5 job tabs for you to review.

### Step 3: Apply with Automation
Get the URLs from those tabs and add to `apply_to_open_jobs.py`:
```python
job_urls = [
    "https://www.seek.com.au/job/80813359",
    "https://www.seek.com.au/job/80813360",
    "https://www.seek.com.au/job/80813361",
    # ... etc
]
```

Then run:
```bash
python apply_to_open_jobs.py
```

### Step 4: Review & Submit
The bot will:
- Auto-fill all detected forms
- Upload your CV
- Keep pages open
- **You manually review and click final "Submit"**

This gives you **safety** - you control the final submission.

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Modify Form Field Selectors
Edit `apply_to_open_jobs.py`:
```python
# Email selectors
for selector in ['input[type="email"]',
                 'input[name*="email" i]',
                 '#email-field']:  # Add custom selectors
```

### Adjust Delays
```python
pyautogui.PAUSE = 0.5  # Delay between actions
await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Wait after clicking
```

### Change CV File
```python
bot = JobApplicationBot(cv_path="my_resume.txt")
```

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Built-in Safety:
- ✅ **No automatic submission** - you review first
- ✅ **Screenshots** for verification
- ✅ **Operation logs** for audit trail
- ✅ **Failsafe** - move mouse to corner to stop
- ✅ **Human-like delays** - avoids bot detection

### What the Bot Won't Do:
- ❌ Submit without your final approval
- ❌ Modify your CV file
- ❌ Store passwords
- ❌ Apply to jobs without your URLs

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: OCR not working
```bash
# Install Tesseract OCR (Windows)
# Download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
# Add to PATH: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR
```

### Issue: Can't find Apply button
```
⚠️  No Apply button found - may require login

# Solution: The bot will:
1. Take a screenshot
2. Save it as job_X_no_apply.png
3. You can manually review
```

### Issue: Form fields not filling
```
# The bot tries multiple selectors
# Check the screenshot to see what's available
# Add custom selectors to the script
```
